## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Configuration

### For Local Development
The app runs locally on `http://localhost:8501` by default.

### For Public Access (Optional)
If you want to share your app publicly using ngrok:

1. Install ngrok and get an authentication token from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
2. In the notebook, replace `YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token:
```python
ngrok.set_auth_token("YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN_HERE")
```
3. Run the ngrok tunnel setup code in the notebook


## Usage

### Restaurant Recommendations Tab
1. Open the Streamlit app in your browser
2. Navigate to the "üîç Restaurant Recommendations" tab
3. Choose your preference:
   - Click **"Pocket-Friendly Plates"** for budget-friendly options (‚Çπ100-‚Çπ1500)
   - Click **"Top-Tier Tastes"** for premium dining experiences (‚Çπ3000+)
4. Browse through the curated restaurant lists with details like cost, location, cuisine, and ratings

### Rating Prediction Tab
1. Navigate to the "‚≠ê Rating Prediction" tab
2. Fill in the restaurant details using the form:
   - **Online Order**: Select availability (True/False)

   - **Location**: Choose from 92 available locations
   - **Restaurant Type**: Select from 87 restaurant types
   - **Cuisines**: Choose from 2367 cuisine combinations
   - **Votes**: Enter number of votes received
   - **Cost**: Enter approximate cost for two people (in ‚Çπ)
3. Click **"Predict Rating"** to get the ML-powered prediction
4. View the predicted rating (0-5 scale) with visual feedback

## Model Information

The rating prediction feature uses an Extra Trees Regressor model trained on Zomato restaurant data.

### Model Features (in order):
1. **Online order**: Binary (True/False for online ordering availability)
2. **Book table**: Binary (True/False for table booking option)
3. **Votes**: Numeric (number of user votes received)
4. **Location**: Categorical (92 unique locations in Bangalore)
5. **Restaurant type**: Categorical (87 unique restaurant types)
6. **Cuisines**: Categorical (2367 unique cuisine combinations)
7. **Cost**: Numeric (approximate cost for two people in ‚Çπ)
8. **Menu item**: Categorical (encoded menu categories)

### Model Performance:
- **Algorithm**: Extra Trees Regressor with 100 estimators
- **Training Data**: Zomato restaurant dataset with 40,000+ records
- **Features**: 8 engineered features from restaurant characteristics
- **Target**: Restaurant rating (0-5 scale)
